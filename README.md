• Backend - JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/)

2 Users list
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

• Implement cancel/revert and submit buttons (should only be active when changes are made)
• Add a button ’See posts’ that redirects to a new page

3 User posts

• Display the user details at the top of the page (information should be editable as on the home page)
• Fetch and display a list of posts for the given user id
• Posts should be editable and deletable through the JSONPlaceholder API - use a confirmation popup for the delete functionality

4 Tasks

• Create a separate /tasks route
• Fetch and display a list of tasks - use HTML table with basic pagination of page size 10
• Allow filtering by task status (completed or not completed), title and owner (user)
• Implement functionality for changing the status of a task - changes should persist through searches

5 Notes

• Cover empty, error and loading states
